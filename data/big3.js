Taurus is not, however, a materialistic sign. On the contrary, a more correct understanding would be that there is a profound emotional connection between physical objects and a strong sense of self-worth.| Taurus relates to all things physical, sensual and real. Accordingly Taureans will be most responsive to what they can see, hear, smell, taste and touch­. Not necessarily concerned with pursuing objects for their own sake, Taureans are here to learn to experience function and form.| That which is tangible, or ‘real’ generates feelings of self-worth for Taurus that are hard to ignore. Taureans will often associate what is in front of them with how they feel about themselves. There can be a deep need to accumulate money and possessions.| Taureans of this type can be all about fixed-term accounts, home deposits and cash at hand. Money and ownership for the sake of security are key motivational factors, rather than the outward glamour or prestige that possessions can bring.| They need money in the bank, and should make sure that security needs are met in order to feel any peace. Once security has been established, then sharing possessions with others will keep the flow of abundance open, allowing those with the Sun in Taurus to gain full benefit from what it is they own.| This is an Earth sign, giving stability, practicality and solidity to the personality structure.

For these reasons, this sign is often characterized by highly sociable and interactive individuals.| This is a sign of adaptability, flexibility, and change. That may vary from changing associates, to changing outfits and changing their minds. At its core, the freedom to be flexible is an essential part of the Gemini journey. Those with the Sun in Gemini can easily switch between their thinking or feeling modes. They react immediately to any stimulation within their environment, swapping opinions and points of focus, depending on prevailing circumstances.| As mentioned, the principle of communication is prominent here. The Gemini individual can seem like a veritable social butterfly, moving from one topic or group of people to the next with ease.

This allows those with the Sun in Cancer to feel a sense of purpose.| Although Cancer is concerned with action, they often tend to move through vacillation and side-stepping. They may avoid direct moves until external circumstances feel favourable or ‘right’.| In this way, they have much in common with their celestial namesake – The Crab. On the outside, they appear tough, hardened or impenetrable, capable of a formidable tenacity. But underneath, they are typically soft and sensitive as can be, protecting their vulnerabilities from the harshness of the outer world.| Cancerians often come at problems sideways in the attempt to avoid being hurt.',

Others will look to Leo to provide cohesiveness and direction. Over time, Leos must learn to accept this role with humility and good grace.| Self-assuredness and a willingness to lead often comes naturally. Leos have gifts of vitality and popularity that assist them on the way. Because of the need to be centre-stage, they thrive on attention and approval. Within moderation, this is fine.| But taken to excess, this can manifest as a constant search for recognition that reveals an insecurity about where their true value lies. Theirs is a journey toward developing a healthy sense of self.| Accordingly Leos are often happy in the spotlight, and will readily become the life of the party if the situation requires. More retiring Leo types may avoid this attention, but secretly wish it was theirs. Whilst Leos may not always want to be centre of attention, it is important they learn to develop the confidence to shine and lead, so that these gifts can be shared.',

Consequently, they can be humble, and at times self-effacing.| It is the natural counterbalance for all the hubris of Leo. The creativity expressed through Leo must be channelled in Virgo so that something can be harvested from all the growth that has occurred. The urge to be of service is often paramount, and Virgos tend to be driven more by the need to be useful than the need to be recognized.| From this perspective, Virgo is especially concerned with processes of discrimination and synthesis. Virgo symbolically represents the integration of material resources so that these can be most effectively used.| Accordingly, Virgo is concerned with efficiency, practicality and economy of means. This can be expressed on either physical and intellectual levels, both internally through the mind or externally through results.| As a Mutable sign, Virgo is also characterized by qualities of duality, so that those with the Sun in Virgo tends to have dual strengths. They often have the ability to blend logical analysis with practical knowhow, combining a sharp intellect with solid skills.| Practicality and usefulness are essential attributes of this sign. As an Earth sign, Virgo is apt to prefer grounded, no-nonsense ways of making things happen. Not all Virgos take the most practical path, but nearly all are solution-focussed.| Virgo will often prefer to contribute from the sidelines, assisting others to achieve tangible results.
